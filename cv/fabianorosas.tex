\textit{Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Federal University of Technology - Parana UTFPR.}\\\\
I'm a final-year student of Computer Science facing the challenge of choosing whether to work in industry or to keep in the academic field. I managed to stand top of class throughout all of my academic career and always tried to absorb all that was being taught to me, which is why I feel very inclined to keep doing research and give back to society in the form of teaching. On the other hand, I'm a curious, fast-learning person and the myriad of technologies that keep Computer Science going make me very excited about the field and are always keeping me busy in my off-school hours, whether through news, hobby projects or self-study. That makes me want to get a job in industry and contribute to this whole ecosystem. I'm very enthusiastic about the impact that software can have in human lives.
